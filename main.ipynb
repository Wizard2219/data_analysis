    "There are many ways to go about this section but we will start with the straight line data boat speeds, compass headings and the GPS COG and SOG to verify the calibration of these instruments. Checking the tidal info and assuming there is little current, we should see if there are any disparities between the two and check if they can be attributed to different heel angles (can mess with compass and paddle wheels), boat speeds (can change with paddle wheels), tacks, and if the differences are consistent between boats. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have an accurate idea of the heading and speed, we can begin to adress the wind triangle. We need to know if the angles provided by the wind gear are based off the compass heading or the GPS COG to be able to single out calibration errors in the wind gear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorting tacks and gybes into different bins based on the wind speed, we can compare the evolution of the TWD, TWA and AWA from tack to tack. Since the former two are calculated from the AWA, these should be the same between tacks if the calibration is right and the boats are sailing the same angles on each tack. \n",
    "We can also calculate the TWD based on the mean headings before and after tacks and gybes to see if there is any disparity between the change in heading, and the sum of the two TWAs. \n",
    "\n",
    "For TWS, we can sort the up and downwind TWS readings looking at the top mark roundings in the log files, or straight line data that are close in time. If there is a strong disparity between TWS numbers, there can be some calibration issues to adress. We can calculate our own AWA and AWS arrays based on the instruments TWS, TWA and the COG and SOG, and we can compare these to the instruments measured raw AWA and AWS values. The differences will reveal the pre-existing calibration, and whether it should change. An advantage or having other boats and instruments on the marks is that we can observe the differences between them. \n",
    "\n",
    "To adress some calibration errors brought on by directional wind shear, we can check if there are any trends in the sail twist data that reveal differences in trim between tacks. If the sailors are good and there are no other reasons (offset tide, chop, dirty air, sailing a course to avoid an island or boat rather than sailing best VMG), then there could be some differences in twist that could result in errors in TWD. \n",

    "Finally, we can adjust the frequencies of the data and filter it to remove outliers. We can also check the VMG data to see any patterns between bad calibration and over/ underperformance on different tacks.\n"

The sailors may want different variables on their screens but the ones that need \"tacking\" mathematically are true and apparent wind angles, heel angles, rudder angle, and foil information. Rather than port and starboard information we make an active and inactive array. We can also make course information with distances, angles, laylines times and distances. These can also change colour and be flipped, between the closest layline and the layline on the other tack - my preference for it to be read first. We can also make some \"what if?\" boxes with the angles on the other tack or gybe. The frequencies of the data coming on the screen also needs some damping for certain arrays. Significant figures can also be adjusted. We can use the polars to calculate targets to display."
